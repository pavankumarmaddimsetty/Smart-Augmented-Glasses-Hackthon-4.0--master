# Smart-Augmented-Glasses-Hackthon-4.0-
Smart Glasses for Police Force, a wearable augmented reality glasses with applications in security, medical and industrial field applications such as remote monitoring surgical operations. Our solution is built with state of the art IOT components integrated with Artificial Intelligence. The glasses essentially automate the process of asking for an ID. When the wearer looks at someone, the attached camera apparently takes precise measurements of the person’s face. That measurement is then compared to a database of individuals, each with their own recorded measurements. The tech is reportedly able to determine a match within seconds. For riders, the police want to make sure the person on the train/plane isn’t traveling with someone else’s ID or hopping a train/plane to avoid police. Catching criminals in a real world crowd just with a glance.  In the last years, more and more wearable devices are being adapted for law enforcement. Next-generation wearables have the potential to enable police officers to improve situational awareness and decision making during missions. Law enforcement needs real-time information for better situational awareness in the field and at the command center. Officers need access to information, to stream videos and to collaborate in real time.
